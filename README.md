# Introduce
The Easy Schedule app helps you create event notes. You can edit and delete those notes before starting the event. App respects its Mvvm architecture. Android Architecture Components Part of Android Jetpack. Android architecture components are a collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.

Proudly üí™ made in Kotlin

## Features
- The user can schedule any Android app which is installed on the device to start at a
specific time
- The user can cancel the schedule if the scheduled app has not started.
- The user can change the time schedule of an existing scheduled app.
- It should support multiple schedules without time conflicts
- User can set Reminder time .

## Architecture
MVVM is one of the architectural patterns which enhances separation of concerns, it allows separating the user interface logic from the business (or the back-end) logic. Its target (with other MVC patterns goal) is to achieve the following principle ‚ÄúKeeping UI code simple and free of app logic in order to make it easier to manage‚Äù.

- Lifecycles: It manages activity and fragment lifecycles of our app, survives configuration changes, avoids memory leaks and easily loads data into our UI.
- LiveData: It notifies views of any database changes. Use LiveData to build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
- Room: It is a SQLite object mapping library. Use it to Avoid boilerplate code and easily convert SQLite table data to Java objects. Room provides compile time checks of SQLite statements and can return RxJava, Flowable and LiveData observables.
- ViewModel: It manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations.
- Repository: The repository depends on a persistent data model and a remote backend data source.
